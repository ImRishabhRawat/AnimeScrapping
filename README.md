## Git Commands 
```
1. First make changes in local where code is present and once you done with your coding run folllowing commands to push your local code in git hub. 
```
```sh
2. Before making any changes firstly you need to add a new branch and work in that branch so that you can track your code with your main branch and if there any problem occurs in that branch you can easily switch to main branch, in this way you can add new thing without inturepting old changes.
    Git command to make new branch:
    git checkout -b <Branch Name>
```

```sh
3. To track your changes you can run :
    git status
```
```sh
4. Add your local changes to staging run 
    git add .
```
```sh
5. After adding changes to staging now commmit your changes with a message.
    git commit -m'Leave your message here'
```
```sh
6. Now push your code into git hub.
 i) While pushing your code first time with every new branch you       need to run this command:
        git push origin <Your Branch Name>
 ii) In every branch after successfully push your code first time and after that you made changes and want to push again that you need to perform a command:
